JavaScript is the language of the browsers.

It is a scripting language.

Node Js is not a language or a framework, it is a JavaScript Runtime more specifically, it is the engine that earlier chrome used to use called V8 engine, it was pulled out and made available to all.

Objects are a key value pair

A function, takes in an input, does something with the data and pulls out the output.

** Functions can take other functions as inputs.


JavaScript is "single threaded".

Core - A place where our code can execute.

More Cores = More powerful Machine

JS and Node.js run on a single core.
Hence they are slow.

JavaScript is Asynchronous in nature.
